## 🔧 Key Tasks Performed

1. 📥 Loaded and inspected raw data  
2. 🧹 Cleaned missing/duplicate values  
3. ➗ Added `discount` and `discount%` columns  
4. 📉 Detected & handled outliers (price, ratings)  
5. 📊 Created histograms, bar plots, pie charts, heatmaps  
6. 🧠 Generated powerful **insights & summaries**

## 📌 Key Insights (Highlights)

- Majority of products are priced under ₹200  
- Ratings mostly between **3.8 and 4.2** — a good satisfaction level  
- **Beauty & Hygiene** is the most loaded category  
- High discounts don’t always equal high ratings  
- Some brands outperform others despite fewer products  
- Very few outliers influence overall distributions — filtered out

🧠 **Final Insight**: Customers trust mid-priced products from known brands more than deeply discounted or overpriced items.
